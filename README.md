# Sketchy Thoughts Tumblr Theme

Sketchy Thoughts is a playful, fun and inspirational Tumblr Theme inspired by
the creativity that only pen and paper gives. It's small, focused and degrades
gracefully in older browsers.

## Current Status

For detailed information, have a look at this project's issues, but in general
the following post types are implemented:

* Text posts
* Quote posts
* Chat posts
* Photo posts (with high-res support)
* Video posts

## Post Icons

Sketchy Thoughts uses Steedicons to differiantiate the different Tumblr post
types. When Sketchy Thoughts is used through Tumblr's theme hosting service
the required icons are included as assets. If Sketchy Thoughts is used outside
of that hosting service, you'll have to add Steedicons font files to the themes
root directory yourself.
